## My personal contribution

We worked in a team of 3 people. I ([lmProgramming](https://github.com/lmProgramming)) was mainly responsible for the Voting System and Recommendation System, on both backend (Golang) and frontend (Flutter). Thanks to test integration, both modules work pretty well. This was the biggest project I co-created in a team for University so far. Both backend and frontend have distinct architectures, thanks to interfaces we were able to easily create mocks, and we usem some design patterns.
